# IRS1120 

An API to accept and convert user (JSON) input to IRS Mordernized E-File(MeF) Compliant Files For transmission to the IRS

## Brief

Add support for IRS Modernized e-File Forms 1120, 1120S, and 1120-F for Tax Year 2020 and beyond to moov-io's irs.
Our design goal is primarily to extend moov-irs to convert JSON input to Modernized e-File files for transmission to the IRS. [Modernized e-File(MeF) Overview](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-overview)

The (MeF) approved file transmission format is XML and as such moov-irs will produce files compliant with IRS Business rules and all [xml schema specifications](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/tax-year-2020-valid-xml-schemas-and-business-rules-for-form-720-modernized-e-file-mef) for (MeF) for the various families of form 1120 starting with 1120.
Regular updates will be made to keep the system up to date with changes in subsequently released instructions from the IRS.
